# ðŸŽ“ PUCRS Software Engineering Archive 

This organization hosts all repositories created during my Software Engineering degree at PUCRS. It serves as a centralized archive to organize, preserve, and showcase the academic projects and assignments developed throughout the course.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
**Centralization**: Group all course-related code in one place.  
**Documentation**: Add context and details to each repository, including:  
- Course or subject name
- Assignment description
- Assessment criteria (when available)

## ðŸš€ Enhancements
Whenever possible, I intend to revisit and improve some of these projects. When doing so, I will:

Tag a release to preserve the original state of the repository as it was delivered during the course.

Build improvements on top of that original version in separate branches or future commits.
